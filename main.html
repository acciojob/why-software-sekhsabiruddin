	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Technology is extremely fast moving, so Software Engineers need to be able to learn new programming languages and technologies and adapt to the continually changing environment. Alongside learning about technology, developers will often have the opportunity to develop their knowledge about the business and sector they are working in, as these are also ever-changing. This constant change is an amazing learning opportunity, keeping your mind fresh and the job interesting! What better reason do you need to get started in Software Engineering?</P>
